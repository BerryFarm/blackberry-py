Overview
=========
This app was built for a demonstration during a presentation made
by Peter Hansen to the Toronto BlackBerry Developers Group (#TOBBDev)
on July 29, 2013.

To build this app, you'll need to install the Python feedparser module.
Visit https://code.google.com/p/feedparser/ for the latest version.
This is a single file, so just put it in the app's folder.

Improvements to the tart package utility to find third-party libraries
in site-packages should eliminate the need for the manual copying.

Todo List
---------
1. Active frame showing most recent post
2. Favourite posts: lock them so they don't get deleted
3. Timed refresh based on the feed's self-reported update frequency
    ("hourly" period, and "1" update in each period)
4. Enhanced notification with additional detail and link back to app?
5. Share to ...
6. Automatic removal of old posts e.g. older than a week (user setting?)

Feel free to add to the list, or contribute implementations of any of these.
