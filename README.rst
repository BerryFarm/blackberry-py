==========================
Courtesy of the BB-Py Project team (see CREDITS), and one or more unnamed
individuals at RIM who had the good sense, motivation, and ability to add
a Python 3.2 runtime into the PlayBook 2.0 OS and not hide it from developers.

More to come here... for now, please note that this is copyrighted software
