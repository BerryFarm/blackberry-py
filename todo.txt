Todo List
------------
*   build tool supporting various profiles for debug builds running from
    shared/misc, release builds, trial release builds (devmode but not
    in shared/misc), etc, eliminating the need for a per-app build.sh
*   port LitePOC code to use bb::cascades::Application from libQtCascades.so
*   detect when trying to run from shared/misc and access_shared not granted
*   starter/template app
*   sample app(s)
*   clean out old stuff or push to subfolder as history
*   improve the CLI code with better editing and command history
*   integrate something like maybe a web-based debug capability ala
    Pylons/Flask, to allow interactive browsing of tracebacks/stack frames
*   improved infrastructure in utility module for things like copying
    the log to shared/documents, catching exceptions etc
*   put a PySide library package on a web site and provide a utility module
    or app which installs it all when loaded/launched

Done
-----
*   bbpy Application support to set initial size to avoid hardcoding in QML
*   standardize on the shared/misc structure for apps for quick development
*   clean up licensing: add our own, document PySide/Qt LGPL stuff
*   wrap FreeType or use an existing wrapper and get some basic text display
*   get images working so simple bitmaps can be arranged onscreen
*   handle errors from PyRun_SimpleFile() and build a traceback string for display
    (done through bbxmain.py instead)
*   make dialogs not system modal
*   check whether the latest beta OS has the bytes/unicode problem with geolocation
*   create App base class with the plumbing
