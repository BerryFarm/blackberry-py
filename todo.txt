Todo List
------------
*   get images working so simple bitmaps can be arranged onscreen
*   check size of corner-swipe area
*   create Event class hierarchy
*   create App base class with the plumbing
*   wrap FreeType or use an existing wrapper and get some basic text display
*   check whether the latest beta OS has the bytes/unicode problem with geolocation
*   receive keyboard events and test with BT keyboard for repeat and special key support
*   provide some callback for display of text (scrolling console output?) in OpenGL context

Done
-----
*   handle errors from PyRun_SimpleFile() and build a traceback string for display
    (done through bbxmain.py instead)
*   make dialogs not system modal
