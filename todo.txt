Todo List
------------
*   build tool supporting various profiles for debug builds running from
    shared/misc, release builds, trial release builds (devmode but not
    in shared/misc), etc, eliminating the need for a per-app build.sh
*   detect when trying to run from shared/misc and access_shared not granted
*   starter/template app
*   sample app(s)
*   improve the CLI code with better editing and command history

Done
-----
*   bbpy Application support to set initial size to avoid hardcoding in QML
*   standardize on the shared/misc structure for apps for quick development
